# About Nadlib

Nadlib is a custom PHP "framework" created by Slawa. It's been used in several dozens projects. The main design goals
are:

* easy to use
* detect everything, no or minimal configuration
* DRY
* do not repeat somebody else's code (uses composer)
* easy to use (maybe I already said that).

# History

It started in 2003 as a collection of PHP classes (mostly static functions) and has grown since.

# [Hello World](helloworld.md)

# ToDo

* ADD a page for calling Apache `ab` and make a responsiveness chart.
